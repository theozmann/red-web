        Well hello there! Welcome to the Red Web Task Force! This is where we can show off our Red Web Task Force badge, and really dig deep into the
    mysteries talked about on the show. Naturally, I wanted to create a little barrier to entry, and you had to inspect the source code to find this message.
    Well done! For an access key, contact me at theboss@redwebtaskforce.com, I'll be waiting -->
